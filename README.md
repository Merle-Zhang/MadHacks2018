## Inspiration

Get inspire from mentor Larson to choose unity, and finally choose Sokoban.

## What it does
Basically like the classical sokoban

And I build it into 3D version with unity.

Using WSADQE:
W - forward
S - backward
A - left
D - right
Q - upward
E - downward

## How I built it

Learn Unity and C# first. Used some free model from Unity market.

## Challenges I ran into

Understanding the detail of c# and Unity. Like the array operation in c# is different with Java and C++.

Also have trouble with Canvas, UI, Physical engine, render size in Unity. But finally find solutions for each problem.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Build this game without any experience in C# and Unity and game development in 24 hours. Learning lots of new things and start the first step of C# develpment.

## What I learned

C#, Unity

## What's next for Sokoban 3D
